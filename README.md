**Summary:**
I am a highly motivated junior MERN Stack Web Developer with a strong focus on backend technologies. I am comfortable with frontend development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and I am in the process of learning Next.js and Redux. My expertise lies in backend development with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and other related technologies. I am a self-learner who extensively relies on documentation while working on projects.

**Projects:**

<h2 align="center">Moviex</h2>

**Why I did this project:** 

- Gain experience with real APIs.
- Work with the TMDB movie API.
- Make working with other APIs easier in the future.
- Practice building production-level React components.

**What I've learned from this project:**

- Working with real-world APIs.
- Creating React components suitable for production-level applications.
- Making components highly reusable.
- Managing application state using Redux.
- Handling errors in the application.
- And various other valuable skills and knowledge.

**Challenges I faced during this project:**

- Displaying a random background image in the header section of the home page.
- Making components highly reusable.
- Implementing search functionality across different pages.
- Handling errors in the application.
- Implementing infinite scrolling for data.

**How I solved these problems:**

- To make components highly reusable, I created a common card format with different data, enabling the same card design throughout the application.
- For implementing search functionality across different pages, I utilized two search bars‚Äîone on the home page and another in the navbar.
- To achieve infinite data scrolling, I incorporated the "react-infinite-scroll" package from npm.
- Managing state across multiple pages with different data requirements was addressed by using Redux for state management.
- I used ternary operators to handle errors in the application.

   - Technology Use: React.js, Redux, TMDB API, etc.

<h2 align="center">Nota Corda Music School</h2>

**Why I did this project:** This project is the final assignment for my complete web development course. I served as both the ***designer and developer*** for this project. It took me about 8 days to complete.

**Features of this project:** This project includes several features, including:

- Separate dashboards for users, instructors, and admins.
- Advanced login and registration authentication systems.
- Admins can delete any user and can promote any user to instructor or admin.
- Instructors can add classes or update/delete their added classes.
- Admin approval is required for adding new instructor classes.
- Users can only purchase a class once.
- A payment system is implemented.
- Dark mode and light mode, among many other features

**What I've learned from this project:** I've learned a lot from this project. I learned how to use MERN stack technology to develop a full-stack web application that works on both the server-side and client-side. I used Node.js with Express.js on the server-side to create the backend, connected it to MongoDB, and created REST APIs. I also handled different dashboards for users, instructors, and admins. I secured REST APIs using JWT. I implemented a payment system using Stripe and an authentication system using Firebase. I also converted the website into dark mode and light mode, among other things.

<h2 align="center">House Hunter</h2>

**Why I did this project:** This was my first job task that I took very seriously. It was an application for the role of a web development instructor with the title "Programming Hero." I primarily applied for the role of a web development instructor. I ranked fourth out of 294 applicants. I made it to the final round, but the competition was tough. They needed to hire three people, but we were the top four candidates. So, there was a competition among the four of us, and I decided to step back a bit.

**Features of this project:** This project boasts an array of exceptional features, including:

- Firebase-based login and registration authentication system.
- Separate dashboards for users, house owners, and administrators.
- Users can purchase a house only once to prevent duplication.
- Restriction on house owners from buying their own properties.
- Administrators are restricted from house purchase.
- Implementation of a payment system.
- Administrators can delete any user or house owner.
- Administrators can promote any user or house owner to administrator status.
- House owners cannot add new properties without admin permission.
- Advanced house filtering and pagination.

**What I've learned from this project:** This project has been a great learning experience for me. I've learned how to create separate dashboards for users, house owners, and administrators. I've implemented various restrictions, such as preventing house owners from buying their own properties and restricting administrators from making house purchases. I've also developed advanced features like house filtering and pagination. This project has equipped me with valuable skills for web development.

**Projects:**

1. **Movix**
   
**Why I did this project:** 

- Gain experience with real APIs.
- Work with the TMDB movie API.
- Make working with other APIs easier in the future.
- Practice building production-level React components.

**What I've learned from this project:**

- Working with real-world APIs.
- Creating React components suitable for production-level applications.
- Making components highly reusable.
- Managing application state using Redux.
- Handling errors in the application.
- And various other valuable skills and knowledge.

**Challenges I faced during this project:**

- Displaying a random background image in the header section of the home page.
- Making components highly reusable.
- Implementing search functionality across different pages.
- Handling errors in the application.
- Implementing infinite scrolling for data.

**How I solved these problems:**

- To make components highly reusable, I created a common card format with different data, enabling the same card design throughout the application.
- For implementing search functionality across different pages, I utilized two search bars‚Äîone on the home page and another in the navbar.
- To achieve infinite data scrolling, I incorporated the "react-infinite-scroll" package from npm.
- Managing state across multiple pages with different data requirements was addressed by using Redux for state management.
- I used ternary operators to handle errors in the application.
